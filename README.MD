## Capstone Project: Mighty Mail

## Intro


## Setup

Clone the repo in your terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:chantal66/mighty-mail.git
```

Navigate to the project with:
```
cd mighty-mail
```
> Note for this project to run properly you need to install dependencies on the 
server and client side.

Install dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

then for the client side:

```
cd client
```

```
npm install
```

to run the app:

```
npm run dev
```

no need to build static files, everytime we push to heroku there's a script to handle this step.
